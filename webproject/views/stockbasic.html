            <h2>What is the stock market?</h2>
            <p>The stock market is a collection of exchanges (like the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ) that make up a greater financial institution. Each exchange tracks a variety of publicly traded companies and their corresponding supply and demand. Investors, whether they are individuals or institutions, utilize these exchanges to make purchases and sales of underlying stocks.</p>
            <h2>Who controls the stock market?</h2>
            <p>Control of the stock market is a complicated concept, because the stock market is a collection of independently controlled exchanges. All United States exchanges are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), however each exchange is publicly traded and owned by a parent company.</p>
            <h2>Where is the stock market located?</h2>
            <p>Around the globe there are over 60 stock exchanges with an estimated $70 trillion market capitalization. The United States has 5 of the largest of the stock exchanges; making up about 40% of the worlds invested capital. The NYSE is the world's largest exchange with a staggering $18 trillion market capitalization, out sizing more than 50 of the worlds smaller exchanges.</p>
            <h2>When is the stock market available?</h2>
            <p>Here in the United States, the stock market opens at 9:30 AM and closes at 4:00 PM Eastern time. There is premarket trading and after-hours trading sessions that varies from broker to broker.</p>
            <h2>How do you invest?</h2>
            <p>To invest in the stock markets, you need to open up an account with a broker. A broker is any individual or trading firm that acts as an intermediary between the exchanges and investors. Most brokers will charge small service fees, but many also offer free trading straight from your smart phone or computer.</p>
