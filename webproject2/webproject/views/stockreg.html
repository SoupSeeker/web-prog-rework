            <h2>Pattern Day Trading</h2>
            <p>When you first get into trading stocks and options, you may encounter a restriction on pattern day trading (PDT). Under the PDT rule, if an investor makes more than three day trades within a rolling five-business-day period, the investor is considered a "pattern day trader" and is subject to certain restrictions. The main restriction is that the trader must maintain at least an account balance of $25,000 before the restriction is released. If exceeded, the trader risks being issued a margin call and must deposit additional funds to meet the call.</p>
            <h2>Securities Act of 1933 & 1934</h2>
            <p>These acts came after the market crashed in 1933 and allow the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate U.S. markets. They require companies that are going public to list their financial information with the SEC so they can monitor and maintain the markets against fraud and corruption.</p>
            <h2>Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</h2>
            <p>This act was enacted in response to accounting scandals such as Enron and WorldCom. It requires public companies to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to disclose information about their financial condition and results of operations.</p>
            <h2>Listing Requirements</h2>
            <p>Each stock exchange has its own listing requirements that companies must meet to be listed on any exchange. These requirements typically include financial and corporate governance standards, as well as minimum trading volume and market capitalization requirements. This ensures that investors have access to a publicly traded companies financial information to make sound investment decisions.</p>
            <h2>Insider Trading Laws</h2>
            <p>Insider trading refers to buying or selling assets in a publicly-traded company while possessing non-public information about the company or its future decisions. The Securities Act of 1934 allows the SEC to investigate and prosecute insider trading cases. Penalties for insider trading are severe and could result in jail time as well as a loss of all profits gained, as well as legal consequences for the underlying company.</p>
